## Babs Gallery

This project is a simple image gallery used to display images from pexels api in a stylish format. 

libraries used were:
- React: Javascript UI library which I used for creating user interfaces
- Typescript: A strongly typed language that builds on javascript and aids in checkmating possible and future errors as types are defined
- Chakra UI: A component library I used to style the user interafaces and components
- Axios: A package used to manage api calls and create interceptors
- React-photo-album: Used to create the image gallery and lightbox functionality
- Yet-another-react-lightbox: Used in addition with the React-photo-album to create the lightbox feature

ALL libraries combined to create a delightful experience.
